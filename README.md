## Introduction

This project demonstrates the structure and usage of features and commands within a Java-based Minecraft client application named "Supremacy." It provides examples of two essential components:

1. **FeatureExample**: A sample feature class that showcases various settings such as color, mode, slider, and toggle. It also includes event handling for the `UpdateEvent`.

2. **CommandToggle**: A sample command class that toggles features on and off. This command takes a feature's name as an argument and toggles its state.

## Features

### FeatureExample

The `FeatureExample` class serves as an example feature with the following settings:

- **Name**: ExampleFeature
- **Description**: Example Feature
- **Category**: Other

#### Settings

- **Example_Color**: A color setting using `@ColorBox`.
- **Example_Mode**: A mode setting using `@Mode` with options "Example_Mode_1" and "Example_Mode_2."
- **Example_Slider**: A slider setting with a range of 0 to 10 and an increment of 1.
- **Example_Toggle**: A checkbox setting.

#### Event Handling

The `FeatureExample` class also subscribes to the `UpdateEvent` to demonstrate event handling.

### Commands

#### CommandToggle

The `CommandToggle` class provides a command for toggling features on and off. It has the following attributes:

- **Name**: Toggle
- **Description**: Toggles a feature.
- **Usage**: toggle <feature>
- **Aliases**: t

This command takes the name of a feature as an argument and toggles its state. It provides feedback on the feature's state after toggling.
